Patches are always welcome.

## Installation
[Download the .zip file](http://ge.tt/3VwqowG/v/0?c) and uncompress it. Go to Chrome's settings page > Extensions (or just type [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)). Click *Load unpacked extension*, browse to the uncompressed folder and select it. Done!

If you ever want your old new tab page back, just disable the extension's checkbox from the [extensions page](chrome://extensions) or remove it completely.
